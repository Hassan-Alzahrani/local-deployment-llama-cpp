## Creating the Conda environment

After adding any necessary dependencies that should be downloaded via `conda` to the `environment.yml` file and any 
dependencies that should be downloaded via `pip` to the `requirements.txt` file you create the Conda environment in a 
sub-directory `./env`of your project directory by running the following shell script.

```bash
./bin/create-conda-env.sh
```

Once the new environment has been created you can activate the environment with the following command.

```bash
conda activate ./env
```

Note that the `./env` directory is *not* under version control as it can always be re-created as 
necessary.
